# QR-Code-Ganerator
QR code generator application, built using HTML and JavaScript, appears to have a simple and clean interface. The main features include:

1. User Input Field: Users can enter text or links, which the generator will encode into a QR code. This input field is styled and positioned centrally for easy access.

2. QR Code Display: Once text is entered, the QR code for that input is generated and displayed prominently on the screen. The QR code image adjusts automatically to reflect the entered data.

3. Title and Styling: The page includes a title, "QR Code Generator," styled in a way that is both visually appealing and functional, giving the app a professional look. The use of Bootstrap ensures a responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

This type of tool is useful for generating QR codes on the fly for sharing URLs, contact details, or other text-based information.
